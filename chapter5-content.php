          	<p><strong>It varies.</strong></p>
            <p>Depending on your website goal, you have two ways to optimize your website.</p>
            
            <ol>
            	<li><strong>Responsive Web Design (recommended)</strong><br />
            	  Decide for a single website that displays content "responsively" for different device and browser 		types.<br />Ex. yoursitehere.com
				</li>
                <li>Create a standalone dedicated mobile website separate from your main website.<br />
Ex. m.yoursitehere.com
				</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>What We Recommend</h3>
            <p>In our opinion, going responsive is the better solution based on all the benefits we've provided in <a href="do-you-need-a-mobile-optimized-website">chapter 2</a> this course.</p>
            <p>This will likely cost you time and money if you decide to hire a developer but this is helpful for websites built on Flash and other outdated web platforms. Developers can use web development themes and techniques to make sure the website is efficient to use and maintain in the long run.</p>

          	<p><strong>It depends.</strong></p>
			<p>If you are a small business that is light on resources, it is best to leave it to the pros. The concept of mobilization is easy to grasp but its process is generally too cost-prohibitive, complicated and time-consuming to go in-house, unless you have the time and experience to directly manage freelance designers.</p>
            <p>There are a wide variety of solutions available for every budget. You will need to study which solution works for you. If you lack time for study, you can consult a web developer or web company to do the research for you.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
          	<ol>
            	<li><strong>Check developer's references and portfolio of mobile websites.</strong><br />
What better way to see how much experience the potential developer has in creating mobile-friendly websites but with their portfolio. You can contact their references and customers to see how they feel about the developer.</li>
				<li><strong>Your developer must understand your mobile customer. </strong><br />
			  Find a developer who understand's UI/UX principles. UI (User Interface) is the method on how a page or product is laid out to bring about what UX (User Experience) research has gathered about how visitors feel about the product. Finding a developer, who understands UX and UI, can bring an engaging output for your users.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask your developer about their commitment on speed. </strong>It is never advisable to make your visitors wait for a page to load in their browser. Ask your potential developer if they're familiar with techniques to help pages load faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Do they install web analytics by default? </strong><br />
              Installing analytics on webpage has become a norm to collect data about a website's performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Make sure developers are aware of Google's Webmaster Guidelines. </strong>For reference, you can take a look at it too: <a href="http://bit.ly/RNTg8Q<" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/RNTg8Q</a></li>
