      <p><strong>You want to boost Search Engine Optimization (SEO) rankings</strong>. SEO is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or web page in a search engine's (e.g. Google) "natural"  or un-paid (organic) search results. Ergo, the more search engines that find your website, the higher your website's search result ranking will be, and the more visitors you will be on your website.</p>
      <p>There are many factors involved to make a webpage successfully rank "naturally" in search engine results. Websites that cater well to both desktop and mobile users will score higher search rankings. You also get only to use one SEO campaign. A single SEO campaign is adequate to maintain the page ranks, as the mobile versions are a part of the website. With this option, content plagiarizing practice is reduced greatly.</p>
