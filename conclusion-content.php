   	<p>Making a mobile-friendly website basically consists of 3 things:</p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li><strong>Make it easy for your customers</strong> to complete their main objectives for coming to your website, regardless of screen size they are using.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure the effectiveness of your website</strong> by how easily your mobile customers complete common tasks on your page. Analytics can help provide you the data needed for reference.</li>
        <li>Integrate a responsive mobile template, theme, or design that's consistent for all devices. Using responsive web design techniques to optimize site experience across different screen sizes without creating multiple websites, helps increase website visits and conversions.</li>
    </ol>               
    
    <p>Mobile optimizing your website will help pave the way for your business to grow your revenue, improve your product or service portfolio, consistently promote your brand on multiple devices, and reach a broader market than you ever thought possible.</p>
